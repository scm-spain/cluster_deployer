# Deployer

Python module to deploy microservices

It contains the AsgardDeployer class, which can be used from other python libraries to manipulate asgard for things like creating applications and deploying them

The `deploy.py` is here for legacy reasons, it was used to find out info from an AWS account and execute the deployer accordingly
